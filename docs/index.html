		<h1>{{title}}</h1>
		<p><b>Between: </b>{{client.name}}<br>
			<b>And: </b>{{author.name}}</p>
		<h3>Summary:</h3>

			<p>You ({{client.name}}), located at {{client.address}} (“You”) are hiring me ({{author.name}}) (“I or
				Me”) for the following services:</p>
			<ul>
				<li ng-repeat="x in services track by $index">{{x}}</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The above services will be used for the production of the following deliverables:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>{{project.title}}</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For the estimated total price of ${{project.cost}} as outlined in our previome correspondence.</p>
			<h4>What do both parties agree to?</h4>
			<p><b>You</b>: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or
				your organisation. You’ll give me the assets and information I tell you I need to complete the
				project. You’ll do this when I ask and provide it in the formats I ask for. You’ll review our
				work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll
				also be bound by dates I set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out
				at the end of this contract.</p>
			<p><b>Me</b>: I have the experience and ability to do everything I've agreed with you and will do it
				all in a professional and timely manner. I'll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and
				on top of that I'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me. </p>

	<!-- <hr> -->

		<h3>Details:</h3>

			<h4>Design</h4>
			<p>I create designs that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I create them
				iteratively and use predominantly HTML and CSS so I won’t waste time mocking up every template
				as a static visual. I may use visuals to indicate a creative direction (colour, texture and
				typography.)</p>
			<p>You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. I'll either share a
				Dropbox, Google Drive folder or Github repository or development site with you and we’ll have
				regular, possibly daily contact by either phone, Slack, or Trello.</p>
			<p>If—at any stage—you change your mind about what you want delivered or aren’t happy with the direction
				our work is taking, you’ll pay me in full for the time we’ve spent working until that point and
				may terminate this contract.</p>

			<h4>Text content</h4>
			<p>Unless agreed separately, I'm not responsible for inputting text or images into your content
				management system or creating every page on your website. I provide professional copywriting
				and editing services, so if you’d like me to create new content or input content for you, we’ll
				provide a separate estimate.</p>
			<h4>Graphics and photographs</h4>
			<p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs
				in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can suggest
				stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for photographs for you, I can provide a separate
				estimate. </p>
			<h4>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h4>
			<p>I deliver pages developed from HTML markup, CSS stylesheets for styling and JavaScript
				for behaviours.</p>
				
			<h4>Browser testing</h4>
			<p>Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different
				capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s
				experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.</p>
			<p>I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple
				(Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), Mozilla (Firefox) and Opera. I won’t test in other
				older browsers unless I agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser,
				I can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>
				
			<h4>Mobile browser testing</h4>
			<p>Testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a
				design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. I test our designs in:
			</p>
			<p><b>iOS</b>: Safari and Google Chrome<br>
				<b>Android</b>: Google Chrome</p>
			<p>I won’t test in Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android devices, or other mobile browsers unless we
				agreed separately. If you need me to test using these, I can provide a separate estimate.</p>
			<h4>Technical support</h4>
			<p>I'm not a website hosting company so I don’t offer support for website hosting, email or other
				services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even
				manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don’t, I will recommend a
				preferred hosting provider. I can set up your site on a server, then plpe any statistics software
				such as Google Analytics and will provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to,
				and management of that server will be up to you.</p>
			<h4>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</h4>
			<p>I don’t guarantee improvements to your website’s search engine ranking, but the pages that we
				develop are accessible to search engines.</p>
			<h4>Changes and revisions</h4>
			<p>I don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract
				is based on the number of hours that I estimate we’ll need to accomplish everything you’ve told
				me you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add
				anything new, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate estimate for those additional
				weeks.</p>
			<h4>Legal stuff</h4>
			<p>I'll carry out my work in accordance with industry standards and at the standard expected from
				a suitably qualified person with relevant experience.</p>
			<p>That said, I can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages,
				including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even
				if you’ve advised me of them.</p>
			<p>Your liability to me will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you
				won’t be liable to me or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or
				other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.</p>
		<p>Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable,
			then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the
			validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
		<h4>Intellectual property rights</h4>
		<p>Just to be clear, “Intellectual property rights” means all patents, rights to inventions, copyright
			(including rights in software) and related rights, trademarks, service marks, get up and trade
			names, internet domain names, rights to goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs,
			database rights, rights in confidential information (including know-how) and any other
			intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all
			applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights and all
			similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or shall subsist now or in the
			future in any part of the world.</p>
		<p>First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned
			by your good selves, or that you’ve permission to use them. When you provide text, images or
			other artwork to us, you agree to protect me from any claim by a third party that I'm using
			their intellectual property.</p>
		<p>I guarantee that all elements of the work I deliver to you are either owned by me or I've obtained
			permission to provide them to you. When I provide text, images or other artwork to you, I
			agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you’re using their intellectual
			property. Provided you’ve paid for the work and that this contract hasn’t been terminated, I'll
			assign all intellectual property rights to you as follows:</p>
		<p>You’ll own the website I design for you plus the visual elements that I create for it. I'll give
			you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I'm not
			required to keep a copy. You own all intellectual property rights of text, images, site
			specification and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.</p>
		<p>I'll own any intellectual property rights I've developed prior to, or developed separately from
			this project and not paid for by you. I'll own the unique combination of these elements that
			constitutes a complete design and I'll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity
			for this project only, unless I agree otherwise.</p>
		<h4>Displaying My work</h4>
		<p>I reserve the right to display all aspects of my creative work,
			including sketches, work-in-progress designs and the completed project in my portfolio and in
			articles on websites, or any other media.</p>
		<h4>Payment schedule</h4>
		<p>Together, we will stick tight to
			the following payment schedule.</p>
		<p>{{project.payment}}</p>
		<p>I issue invoices electronically. My payment terms are 7 days from the date of invoice by
			BACS or the SWIFT international payments system, or CashApp. All proposals are quoted in USD and
			payments will be made at the equivalent conversion rate at the date the transfer is made.</p>
		<p>You agree to pay all charges associated with international transfers of funds. The appropriate bank
			account details will be printed on our electronic invoice. I reserve the right to charge
			interest on all overdue debts at the rate of {{interestRate}}% per month or part of a month.</p>

		<p>We both agree that we’ll adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities
			under this contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.</p>
		<p>This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract
			becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.</p>
		<p>Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document
			under jurisdiction of Georgia Law.</p>
